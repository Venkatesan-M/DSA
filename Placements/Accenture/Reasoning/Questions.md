## 🔤 Alphabet-Based Questions

Use this table as a reference for solving alphabet pattern problems. Write it down on your rough sheet during the exam:

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |
| Z | Y | X | W | V | U | T | S | R | Q | P | O | N |
| 26| 25| 24| 23| 22| 21| 20| 19| 18| 17| 16| 15| 14 |
| 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 |
| N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |

Memorizing both forward and reverse positions can help with pattern recognition in alphabet-related questions.

## 🔢 Numerical Series Patterns

Here are the common logic types you should look for when solving number series questions:

### 1. ➖ Simple Difference
- Look at the difference between consecutive numbers.
- **Example:** `2, 5, 8, 11...` → Difference of `+3`

### 2. ➕ Difference of Differences
- Calculate the difference between the differences.
- **Example:** `2, 4, 7, 11, 16...` → First differences: `+2, +3, +4, +5`

### 3. ➕🔁 Second-Order Difference (Difference³)
- Sometimes, you'll need to go to the third level of differences.
- **Example:** `1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16...`

### 4. 🟪 Square Pattern
- Each number may be a perfect square or based on square logic.
- **Example:** `1, 4, 9, 16...` → `n²`

### 5. 🧊 Cube Pattern
- Numbers follow cube logic.
- **Example:** `1, 8, 27, 64...` → `n³`

### 6. 🔄 Multiplicative Patterns
- **Patterns like:**  
  - `×2 + 1`  
  - `×2² + 1`  
  - `×2³ + 1`
- **Example:** `1, 3, 7, 15...` → Multiply and add

### 7. 📈 Multipliers with Decimals
- Patterns involving fractional or increasing multipliers.
- **Examples:**  
  - `×1.5, ×2, ×2.5...`  
  - `×3, ×3.5...`


### 8. Simple Interest
- Interest is calculated by multiplying the principal by the interest rate.
- **Example:** `×1.5, ×2, ×2.5...` → Multiply and add

```sh
    A = P * R * T
```

### 9. Component Interest



### Day frome date

2000 - 6
2100 - 4
2200 - 2
2300 - 0
